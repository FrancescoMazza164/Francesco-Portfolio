							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>
								My name is <strong>Francesco Amedeo Mazza</strong>. I am currently 16 years old and visit grade 11 at Phorms Campus Berlin Süd.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							My interests in school are <strong>Spanish</strong>, as I am Italian and find it quite easy to unterstand, and <strong>PE</strong> as I am always full of energy and ready to excersize. Besides school I play football for <strong>Viktoria Berlin 1889 and Tennis for Grün-Weiß  Lankwitz</strong>. I recently started to visit the <strong>gym</strong> once or twice a week and love to find the time to get out of the house and <strong>walk through Berlin City with some friends</strong>. What I love the most though, is to <strong>travel and explore the world</strong>. Luckiley, my parents have always found the time to travel and I had the privelage to visit many various countries and was able to explore their vivid cultures.
